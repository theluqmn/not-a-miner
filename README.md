# Not a Miner

Mine your way to the moon!

For the sake of why not, you purchase mining equipment and energy generators. You are mining Dogecoin (DOGE). Not a Miner is a browser-based cryptocurrency mining simulator game, based on my COVID-era [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) hit, Dogecoin Miner.

## Features

- Exchange DOGE for cash using real-world rates.
- Increase your mining rate by purchasing GPUs and ASICs.
- Stay off the grid using your own energy generators - skip the expensive electricity bills.
- Buy space for more mining machines.
- Make a ton of money!

## To-do

- **v1.0**
- [ ] integrate [coingecko pricing API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for DOGE pricing
- [ ] mining mechanics (includes energy consumption)
- [ ] local storage management
- [ ] switch UIs
- [ ] shop mechanics
- [ ] fancy UI pages
- [ ] purchase miners
- [ ] purchase energy generators
- [ ] release to [itch.io](itch.io)
- **v1.1**
- [ ] offline mining
- **v1.2**
- [ ] storage mechanics
- [ ] purchase storage slots

Not a Miner is considered complete by **v1.2** - no further updates are planned.

## Notes

I started this project to regain coding momentum. The features and scope of the project is deliberately made limited to avoid overcomplexity as its my first simulator game in a while. If I managed to finish this by the weekend, there will be a sequel featuring major gameplay with the same underlying mechanics. Stay tuned.
